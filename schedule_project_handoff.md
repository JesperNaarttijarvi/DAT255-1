# Schedule Project Handoff

Please add your group number to a `Free` slot. Please leave the slots marked `Spare` to groups that require a specific day. If possible, fill up days before you start another (if the day does not matter to you). We will run presentations in blocks of 3, followed by a break. So, the 4th presentation will start at 14:15.

You going to have access to following: micro HDMI and VGA connected to projector,blackboard. I also recommend using some recording tool
Recommended recording tools(both need root):

- SCR Screen Recorder Free
- Z - Screen recorder

Each group will have about 15 minutes to present. Try to use 10 mins for presentation and leave 5 mins for questions. You presentation should focus on:

- What does your app do?
- What makes it special?
- What design decisions did you make?
- How did you work?
- What did you learn?

Note that the schedule is very tight, so please be as prepared as possible (test your equipment, make sure you only need 10 mins, etc.)
