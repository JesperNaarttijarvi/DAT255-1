# Software Engineering Project - HT13

## Course Description
Software remains malleable, often illogical, and incomplete forever. *Sequential approaches* to software development, such as the *waterfall model*, assumes that it is possible to take every single variable that could affect a project into account beforehand. Considerable effort is spent to identify risks, plan mitigation, and what consequences these may have. From a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to creating an assembly line to produce software.

Given the nature of software, is it really feasible to identify all variables beforehand? *Iterative and incremental approaches* accepts that changes are inevitable and integrates change management into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle. If we again use a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to new product development.

In this course you will teach you how to design and develop software, and to manage projects, using these agile principles:

- The customer is a part of the development team Incremental development 
- The developer should not be hindered by the process 
- Embrace changes 
- Continues refactoring (restructuring) of the design
 
After passing the course, you will be able to lead agile projects, work without a detail schedule, use test driven development, refactor programs, be part of a programming pair, and much more.

## Hand-ins

You will release a version of your project every Friday. For each release we will introduce additional critera that are used to "judge" the release.

| Course Week | What to include / what will be checked |
| :---------: | -------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Form a group and submit three app ideas |
| 2 | Submit a vision (with features) for your selected app | 
| 3 | **Release 1**: Your should have a Git repo with an initial version of your app |
| 4 | **Release 2**: focus on testing |
| 5 | **Release 3**: focus on code quality |
| 6 | **Release 4**: Final release, focus on product quality |
| 7 | **Release 5**: Bug fixes and polish |
| 8 | Post-mortem report |

## Examination

## Sample project
To give you an idea of what a project might look like in the end, we've been authorized to publish this project which was made during the fall semester (2012).
