# Course PM for Software Engineering Project (DAT255/DIT543) 7.5 HEC, Spring 2017

## News
- Added an [FAQ][FAQ]
- Let's get started!
- Feb 20: A first version of the course homepage is up and running. The homepage will be continuously edited, reflecting the evolution of the course.


## Course Description
Software remains malleable, often illogical, and incomplete forever. *Sequential approaches* to software development, such as the *waterfall model*, assumes that it is possible to take every single variable that could affect a project into account beforehand. Considerable effort is spent to identify risks, plan mitigation, and what consequences these may have. From a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to creating an assembly line to produce software.

Given the nature of software, is it really feasible to identify all variables beforehand? *Iterative and incremental approaches* accepts that changes are inevitable and integrates change management into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle. If we again use a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to new product development.

## Course Project
Most of the course time is spent on a course project. This term the project is run in collaboration with the [PortCDM project][PortCDM]. As students you will be assigned the task of implementing the frontend for one of the stakeholders involved in maritime shipping. The teams will then have the task to demonstrate the full chain of events as a cargo vessel leaves a port and arrives at the next destination. More information about the project scope will be given on the lecture held Apr 03.

## Learning outcomes
In this course you will learn how to design and develop software, and to manage projects:
- Knowledge and understanding, the student should be able to:
	- identify the complexities of software design and development
	- describe the fundamentals of software engineering, such as stakeholders and requirements
	- describe the difference between the Customer, the Solution, and the Endeavour as well as the different methods used for each

- Skills and abilities, the student should be able to:
	- elicitate requirements from and design a solution to a real-world problem
	- plan and execute a small software development project in a team
	- apply skills from programming courses and other relevant courses in a project-like environment
	- learn new tools and APIs on his/her own

- Judgement and approach, the student should be able to:
	- reflect on the choice of software engineering methods used in the project

Since a substantial part of the work is conducted in teams, please consider the [Chalmers rules regarding your work conditions][CRS]. If you encounter problems, contact Håkan immediately!

## Examination
The individual grades are based on the team contribution. Contribution is in turn defined according to *Stakeholder value*, *Protoype* and *Reflection report*. Each category represents a certain number of points so that the total number of points sums to 50. The points are not evenly distributed across the categories since the assessment occurs at different points in time and represent different efforts.

### Pass / Fail
To pass the course **each team** has to deliver:

- D1: A one-page document drawing on the lessons from the Lego scrum exercise on how to initially work with scrum. Describe three strategies for improving how you implement Scrum in your project, based on the experiences from the LEgo exercise. A strategy can be that you want to do more or less of a practice, or that you want to change how you applied a practice. Mention why you chose the strategy and how the strategy will be implemented. We also want a [social contract][socialcontract] for the team. Both the scoial contract and the strategies should be uploaded to the team git repo before Mar 24 17.00. The strategies should also be e-mailed to HB before Mar 24 17.00. 
- D2: Choose three KPIs to monitor your implementation of Scrum. Motivate your choice and upload the document to the team git repo before Mar 31 17.00.
- D3A: An initial product backlog. E-mail an invitation to your scrum board to JS before Apr 04 17.00. You are free to choose any scrum board technology you want but make sure you can share it.
- D3B: A business model for your system. To be uploaded to the team git repo before Apr 07 17.00.
- D4: Half-time evaluation: A one-page document reflecting on the work so far, both in terms of process and product. D4 should be uploaded to the git repo before May 10 15.00.
- D5: Final presentation: The fifth deliverable is a *working prototype* (APK) for the final presentation. D5 should be uploaded to the git repo before May 22 13.00.
- D6: General relase: The last deliverable consists of the source code and the output from [gitinspector][GitInspector] as well as the artefacts asked for under [Prototype](### Prototype) and the [Reflection Report](### Reflection Report). Do not touch the git repo after Jun 02 17.00.

within the designated deadlines.

To pass the course **a student** has to deliver:
- evidence for active participation in the team effort. The level of student participation is determined on a combined assessment of the output from [gitinspector][GitInspector] and the mean values from the team evaluation. 
- an evaluation of the members of the team, including themselves. Imagine that you have a budget of $10 per group member, including yourself (so, $50 for a group of 5). How would you distribute this "pay" among your group members, based on their value and contribution? Submit your evaluation using our [new online web survey][PersonalSurvey] before Oct 28 17.00. (The evaluation will not affect the group grade, it will only be used to determine individual variation within a group. However, if you do not submit this evaluation, you will not pass the course).

within the designated deadline

### Stakeholder value, 12p
The stakeholder value is assessed during the final presentation. The total score is the sum of
- Completeness (prioritised features in backlog are present, one application and stable operation)
- GUI (self-explanatory for intended users, clarity and no excess information) 
- Relevance (efficiency and clear relation to problem domain)
- Acceptance tests and stakeholder interaction

Each part is worth 0-3 points where 0 represents failed delivery, 1 equals major remarks, 2 signifies minor remarks and 3 no remarks. 

### Prototype, 15p
All artefacts related to the prototype should be in the Git repository. These will be assessed after the final deadline of the course. 
- Code quality, 3p. Code quality is based on the verdict of [FindBugs][FindBugs] where the sum of issues gives the number of points for code quality
  - 0-5 = 3p
  - 5-10 = 1p
  - >10 = 0p where the impact of each kind of *Correctness issues* counts as 4,  *Bad style* as 2,  *Dodgy* as 2  and *Performance* as 1. Each team is responsible for uploading the FindBugs report to their repository.
- Unit / integration / system tests, 3p
- Design rationale (choice of API-level, external dependencies, database structure etc.), 3p
- Overview, 3p
  - Behavioural
  - Structural (What major parts / components are there in the application)
  - Protocol (client/server) 
- User stories, 3p 

Each part worth 3 points has an allocation strategy where 0 represents failed delivery, 1 equals major remarks, 2 signifies minor remarks and 3 no remarks. 

### Reflection report, 23p
The reflection report is also uploaded to the git repository as a PDF-file. It will be assessed after the final deadline of the course.
- Application of scrum
  - Roles, team work and social contract (relates to D1B)
  - Used practices (pair programming, stand-up meetings, etc.)
  - Time distribution (person / role / tasks etc.)
  - Effort and velocity and task breakdown
- Reflection on the sprint retrospectives
- Documentation of sprint retrospectives, 0-1p
- Reflection on the sprint reviews
- Best practices for using new tools and technologies
- Reflection on the relationship between *prototype*, *process* and *stakeholder value*
- Relating your own process to literature and guest lectures
- Evaluation of D1, D2 and D4
- KPI charts, 0-1p 

Each part worth 3 points has an allocation strategy where 0 represents failed delivery, 1 equals major remarks, 2 signifies minor remarks and 3 no remarks. Including sprrint retrospectives for all sprints gives 1 point, including the burn-down chart is also worth 1 point.

Reflection is here defined as *“assessment of what is in relation to what might or should be and includes feedback designed to reduce the gap”* (R. Smith. Formative Evaluation and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. *New Directions for Teaching and Learning*, vol. 88, 2001, pp. 51-62). This means that you should describe the situation as it is, what you would like it to be (or alternative routes you could have taken) as well as a realistic way to get there.


### Grades
The team grade is given by the total number of points for the team effort:
- 00 - 20: U (Fail)
- 21 – 30: 3 / G (Pass)
- 31 – 40: 4
- 41 – 50: 5 / VG

The team grade then serves as a baseline for the individual grades so that students with higher contributions **and** team effort receive a higher grade than the team grade and students with lower individual scores receive a lower grade. Higher and lower are approximately 25% more / less than team average. *Please use the [online survey][PersonalSurvey] to assess your own and your team mates contribution*. And remember to include yourself!

We strive for a transparent and fair assessment strategy. [That is why we as teachers are the ones that do the grading based on our experience][fairgrades].
