# Course PM for Software Engineering Project (DAT255/DIT543) 7.5 HEC, HT2015

## News
Jul 1st: Homepage is up and running. The homepage will be continuously edited, reflecting the evolution of the course.

## Course Description
Software remains malleable, often illogical, and incomplete forever. *Sequential approaches* to software development, such as the *waterfall model*, assumes that it is possible to take every single variable that could affect a project into account beforehand. Considerable effort is spent to identify risks, plan mitigation, and what consequences these may have. From a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to creating an assembly line to produce software.

Given the nature of software, is it really feasible to identify all variables beforehand? *Iterative and incremental approaches* accepts that changes are inevitable and integrates change management into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle. If we again use a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to new product development.

## Course Project
The most of the time is spent on a course project. This year the project is integrated with the [Electricity Innovation Challenge][EICWeb]. As students you will participate in the challenge in teams of five where each team is to develop an android app that addresses one of the three challenges:
- More efficient or fun travelling
- Attractive bus stops
- A journey for everyone

More details about the challenge will be presented at the lecture given on 2nd of September.

## Learning outcomes
In this course you will learn how to design and develop software, and to manage projects:
- Knowledge and understanding, the student should be able to:
	- identify the complexities of software design and development
	- describe the fundamentals of software engineering, such as stakeholders and requirements
	- describe the difference between the Customer, the Solution, and the Endeavour as well as the different methods used for each

- Skills and abilities, the student should be able to:
	- elicitate requirements from and design a solution to a real-world problem
	- plan and execute a small software development project in a team
	- apply skills from programming courses and other relevant courses in a project-like environment
	- learn new tools and APIs on his/her own

- Judgement and approach, the student should be able to:
	- reflect on the choice of software engineering methods used in the project

## Supervision

There is no regular supervision. During the three first weeks of the course there will be workshops where you can learn how to use Git and Android. During the project you will have access to your customers through workshops, see the homepage of the [Electricity Innovation Challenge][EICWeb].

## Examination
Every *group* should submit the following at the end of the course:

- Working app (APK) that will be demonstrated at the project presentations. 
- Documentation (produced during the project):
	- Vision
	- A few user stories
	- Developer documentation (information relevant to people who work on the project) Suggestions:
		- How does the build process work
		- What major parts / components are there in the application
		- Design decisions (such as API level, etc.)
		- UML
		- Flowchart
		- Protocol (client/server )
		- External dependencies
		- Others that fit your project.
	- User manual
- [Post-mortem Report][pmr]

Note that the amount of documentation will vary depending on project, but *every group* **must** submit some documentation. If you are unsure about what to document, consult your supervisor and check the sample project.

Every *person* should submit a brief evaluation of the group. Imagine that you have a budget of $10 per group member, not including yourself (so, $50 for a group of 6). How would you distribute this "pay" among your group members, based on their value and contribution? Note that you are not allowed to pay everyone the same amount! Email your evaluation (name and amount for each group member not including yourself) to morgan@cse.gu.se no later than May 31 24:00. (The evaluation will not affect the group grade, it will only be used to determine individual variation within a group. However, if you do not submit this evaluation, you will not pass the course).

You can find more information about the [grading policy][grading] in the wiki.

## Sample project
To give you an idea of what a project might look like in the end, we've been authorised to publish this project which was made during the fall semester (2012). Note that this project is a regular Android app, so use it to get an idea about documentation and such.
