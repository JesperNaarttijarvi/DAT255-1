# Software Engineering Project - VT13

## Course Description
Software remains malleable, often illogical, and incomplete forever. *Sequential approaches* to software development, such as the *waterfall model*, assumes that it is possible to take every single variable that could affect a project into account beforehand. Considerable effort is spent to identify risks, plan mitigation, and what consequences these may have. From a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to creating an assembly line to produce software.

Given the nature of software, is it really feasible to identify all variables beforehand? *Iterative and incremental approaches* accepts that changes are inevitable and integrates change management into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle. If we again use a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to new product development.

In this course you will teach you how to design and develop software, and to manage projects, using these agile principles:

- The customer is a part of the development team Incremental development 
- The developer should not be hindered by the process 
- Embrace changes 
- Continuous refactoring (restructuring) of the design
 
After passing the course, you will be able to lead agile projects, work without a detail schedule, use test driven development, refactor programs, be part of a programming pair, and much more.

## Hand-ins

You will release a version of your project every Friday. For each release we will introduce additional critera that are used to "judge" the release.

| Course Week | What to include / what will be checked |
| :---------: | -------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Form a group and submit three app ideas |
| 2 | Submit a vision (with features) for your selected app | 
| 3 | **Release 1**: Your should have a Git repo with an initial version of your app |
| 4 | **Release 2**: focus on testing |
| 5 | **Release 3**: focus on code quality, such as readability, consistency, stability, correctness, conciseness, documentation in the form of comments and good naming conventions |
| 6 | **Release 4**: Final release, focus on product quality |
| 7 | **Release 5**: Bug fixes and polish |
| 8 | Post-mortem report |

Note that the Post-mortem report and the application (including source code, etc.) **must** be handed in **TBA**.

## Examination

Every *group* should submit the following at the end of the course:

- Working Android app (APK)
- Documentation (produced during the project):
	- Vision
	- A few user stories
	- Developer documentation (information relevant to people who work on the project) Suggestions:
		- How does the build process work
		- What major parts / components are there in the application
		- Design decisions (such as API level, etc.)
		- UML
		- Flowchart
		- Protocol (client/server )
		- External dependencies
		- Others that fit your project.
	- User manual
- [Post-mortem Report][pmr]

Note that the amount of documentation will vary depending on project, but *every group* **must** submit some documentation. If you are unsure about what to document, consult your supervisor and check the sample project.

Each *group* will be given 10 + 5 mins to present their application. The presentation should introduce the app (including the major features), interesting design decisions, the process, and a brief reflection. 
(You going to have access to following: micro HDMI and VGA connected to projector,blackboard. I also recommend using some recording tool)

Every *person* should submit a brief evaluation of the group. Imagine that you have a budget of $10 per group member, not including yourself (so, $60 for a group of 7). How would you distribute this "pay" among your group members, based on their value and contribution? Note that you are not allowed to pay everyone the same amount! Email your evaluation (name and amount for each group member not including yourself) to morgan@cse.gu.se no later than TBA. (The evaluation will not affect the group grade, it will only be used to determine individual variation within a group. However, if you do not submit this evaluation, you will not pass the course).

## Sample project
To give you an idea of what a project might look like in the end, we've been authorized to publish this project which was made during the fall semester (2012).
